# SM7B – General (Vocal Capture Rig)

Purpose: fast, repeatable vocal capture for composition, scratch, and keepers when the performance is right.

Scope (v0):

- Focus on physical setup and repeatability (stand, distance, angle, pop control).
- Avoid committing to “tone chain” decisions early.
- Routing is intentionally honest (“Frighten The Child”) to keep performances real.

Outputs:

- Rendered audio only (no MIDI assumptions).
- Notes and any deviations captured in song-level `rig-overrides.md`.
