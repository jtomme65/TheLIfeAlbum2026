# Routing – SM7B General

## Inputs

- RME Mic Input: (document actual channel number when standardized)

## Track setup (Reaper)

- Mono track
- Input: selected RME mic input
- Record mode: normal (audio)
- Monitoring: ON

## Monitoring preset: “Frighten The Child” (Truth Monitor)

Intent: reveal what is actually being captured so technique improves quickly.

Guidance:

- Use this when dialing mic placement and performance.
- If the honesty causes performance inhibition, switch temporarily to “Comfort Monitor.”
  (Comfort Monitor can be defined later; do not let monitoring prevent recording.)

## v0 Rule

- Prefer simple: record clean.
- Do not commit to corrective processing on the way in during composition.
