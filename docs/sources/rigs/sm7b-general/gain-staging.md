# Gain Staging – SM7B General

Goal: capture clean vocal with enough headroom to stay safe during unexpected peaks.

## v0 Approach (simple)

- Set input gain so loud passages do NOT clip.
- Aim for “healthy but safe” — the exact number isn’t the point at this stage.

## Practical steps

1. Have singer perform the loudest expected phrase.
2. Raise gain until the vocal feels present.
3. Back off slightly so surprise peaks stay clean.
4. If you can’t get enough level without noise:
   - Consider inline gain (Cloudlifter) OR external preamp (Grace M101)
   - Document the change and why.

## When to add Cloudlifter / external preamp

Use extra gain if:

- You’re near max gain on the interface and still too quiet, OR
- Noise floor becomes distracting, OR
- The tone becomes thin due to insufficient clean gain.

## Notes to capture when deviating

- Interface input used
- Gain knob position / approximate setting
- Whether phantom power was enabled (only if using inline gain device that requires it)
- Any observed noise / hiss / artifacts
