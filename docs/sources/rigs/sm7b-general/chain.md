# Chain – SM7B General

## v0 Signal Path (minimal)

- Latch Lake stand → Shure SM7B → XLR cable → RME mic input

## Notes

- No bias toward any particular preamp for v0.
- If more gain is needed later:
  - Option A: enable additional clean gain (external preamp)
  - Option B: add inline gain (Cloudlifter or similar)
  - Track these changes in `gain-staging.md` and song overrides when used.

## Physical accessories (optional)

- Pop filter: use if singer is close or plosives are strong.
- Shock mount: not required; SM7B is forgiving, but can be used if stand/floor vibration is present.

## Physical setup (Latch Lake)

- Height: capsule roughly at mouth level
- Distance: start close enough for intimacy, far enough to avoid plosives
- Angle: slight off-axis if plosives/sibilance are strong
- Adjustments: move the mic, not the EQ
