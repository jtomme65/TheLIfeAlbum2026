# Intent

This monitor recipe exists to answer one question:

> “What do I actually sound like right now?”

It deliberately avoids sweetening, time-based effects, or corrective processing.
Any discomfort is information.

This recipe is intended to:
- Improve mic technique
- Improve singer consistency
- Surface issues early rather than fixing them later

This is not a headphone mix for comfort.
This is a reference monitor for truth.
